# Installing [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)

Scala can run on the JVM, but also has support for JS integration and even compilation to native code.
For help install various dependencies, consider using [Scala-CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)

Another alternative is [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/)
to manage your Java and Java-adjacent development tools and libraries.

If you do wish to have full control over package installation, you need to manually install

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later. Use your preferred vendor or grab one from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Scala 3.1.x](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
* [sbt 1.7.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)



---

After installing Java and `sbt` you will be ready to get started with the Scala track of Exercism.

To get started, see "[Running the Tests](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/scala/tests)".
